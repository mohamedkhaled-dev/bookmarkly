# Bookmarkly - Save Your Favorite Websites

Bookmarkly is a simple app that helps you save and organize your favorite websites. It’s built using only front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), so no backend is needed. You can easily add, visit, and delete bookmarks.

## ✨ Features
- 📂 **Add Bookmarks**: Save websites by adding a title and URL.
- 🌐 **Visit Bookmarks**: Click on a saved bookmark to open it in a new tab.
- 🗑️ **Delete Bookmarks**: Remove bookmarks you no longer need.
- ⚡ **No Backend**: All your data is stored using local storage.

## 💡 Why I Built It
I created this app to practice working with local storage and improve my skills in JavaScript and front-end development. It was a great way to build something useful while learning more about DOM manipulation.
